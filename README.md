# 🚀 Helios Portal

Helios Portal is the **official entry point** to the **Helios Blockchain**, providing users with a seamless interface for **bridging, staking, delegation, governance voting, and portfolio management**. This platform simplifies interactions across the Helios ecosystem while ensuring **security, efficiency, and interchain connectivity**.

## 🌟 Features

- **Cross-Chain Bridging** – Move assets between Helios and external blockchains.
- **Staking & Delegation** – Secure the network by staking tokens and delegating to validators.
- **Governance & Voting** – Participate in decentralized governance decisions.
- **Portfolio Management** – Track assets, rewards, and governance activities.
- **EVM & Cosmos Integration** – Seamlessly connects with EVM wallets and Cosmos-based tools.
- **Decentralized by Design** – Helios Portal operates entirely on **Helios Node RPC**, eliminating reliance on centralized APIs or backend services. You can deploy and run the frontend on the mainnet independently.
